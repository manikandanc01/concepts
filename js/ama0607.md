12. 

```
 //file1.js
   let ar = [1,2,3];
   console.log("Hello");
   module.exports.ar = ar; 
```

``` 
   //file2.js
   const {ar} = require('file1.js');
   let print = ar; 
   console.log(print);
```
```
 Output: Hello 
         [1,2,3]
```
Why "Hello" is also printed ? when we have exported array('ar') only!


## Solutions:

### 1. What is the difference between (==) and (===) operator?:

The main difference between the **== (loose equality)** and **=== (strict equality)** operators in JavaScript is how they handle type coercion.

 ####  Loose Equality(==):

 It will try to convert the operands to a common type before comparing them.

For example, **5 == '5'** will evaluate to **true** because the **string '5'** is converted to the **number 5** before the comparison.


#### Strict Equality(===):
Performs a strict comparison, meaning it will check both the value and the data type of the operands.

For example, **5 === '5'** will evaluate to **false** because the **number 5** and the **string '5'** have different data types.

### 2. Why console.log(typeof []) is equal to 'object':

In JavaScript, arrays are objects, so typeof [] returns 'object'. The typeof operator doesn't distinguish between different kinds of objects like arrays or null.

### 3. What are the disadvantages of using closure?

* **Memory Leaks:** Closures can lead to memory leaks if not managed properly, as they can hold references to variables that are no longer needed, preventing them from being garbage collected.
* **Performance Impact:** Closures can have a performance impact, especially in cases where they are used extensively or in performance-critical parts of the application.
* **Complexity:** Closures can make the code more complex and harder to understand, especially when used in large or complex applications.
* **Scope Issues:** Closures can lead to scope-related issues, such as unexpected variable access or modification, if not used carefully.

### 4. Why using global variables are bad in JS?

* **Naming Conflicts:** Global variables can lead to naming conflicts, especially in large applications where multiple developers are working on the same codebase.
* **Performance Impact:** Accessing global variables can be slower than accessing local variables, as the JavaScript engine needs to search the global scope.
* **Unintended Modifications:** Global variables can be accidentally modified or overwritten, leading to unintended behavior and hard-to-debug issues.

### 5. How do you extract certain properties from an array of objects to create a new array?

We can use the **map()** method to extract specific properties from an array of objects and create a new array:

```
const data = [
  { id: 1, name: 'John', age: 30 },
  { id: 2, name: 'Jane', age: 25 },
  { id: 3, name: 'Bob', age: 35 }
];

const newArray = data.map(item => ({ id: item.id, name: item.name }));
console.log(newArray);
// Output: [{ id: 1, name: 'John' }, { id: 2, name: 'Jane' }, { id: 3, name: 'Bob' }]
```

In this example, the **map()** method is used to create a new array newArray that contains only the id and name properties from the original data array.

### 6. Difference between charAt() and at() method in js ?

`charAt(index):` Returns the character at the specified index in a string.

```
 'hello'.charAt(1);  // 'e'
```
`at(index):` Works with both strings and arrays and supports negative indices.
```
'hello'.at(1);  // 'e'
'hello'.at(-1); // 'o'
```

### 7. How to reset the initial or 1st commit in git, if it's possible?

Yes, it is possible using interactive rebase.
```
git rebase -i --root
```
Then change pick to edit for the first commit, make your changes, and amend the commit:
```
git commit --amend
git rebase --continue
```

### 8. If console.log(typeof []) returns 'object', then why can not we use the (.) operator in the array to access 

* The reason why console.log(typeof []) returns **'object'** is that in **JavaScript**, **arrays** are considered a subtype of the object type. 
* This is because **arrays** are implemented as **objects**, with additional properties and methods specific to arrays.
* However, you can't use the dot (.) operator to access array values because arrays have a different syntax for accessing their elements. 
* Arrays use the bracket notation ([]) to access their elements, like this: array[index]. The dot notation (.) is typically used to access properties and methods of objects, not arrays.

### 9. Why 'forEach' loop skip 'not defined' whereas the 'for' loop gives 'undefined'?

The difference in behavior is due to the way the two loops handle missing or undefined elements. The **forEach** loop is more forgiving, as it skips over elements that are 'not defined', whereas the **for loop** will return **'undefined'** for those elements.

### 10. How can we mimic the action Array.splice() and Array.slice() on objects

For `splice` (modify the original object):
```
let obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
delete obj.b;
console.log(obj); // { a: 1, c: 3 }
```
For `slice` (create a new object):

```
let obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
let newObj = (({ a, c }) => ({ a, c }))(obj);
console.log(newObj); // { a: 1, c: 3 }
```

### 11. What is the "Callback Hell" problem and how to avoid it?

Callback Hell refers to deeply nested callback functions, making code hard to read and maintain.
**Avoiding Callback Hell:**

* **Using Promises:**
    ```
   doSomething()
    .then(result => doSomethingElse(result))
    .then(newResult => doAnotherThing(newResult))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
    ```

* **Using async/await:**
    ```
    try {
        const result = await doSomething();
        const newResult = await doSomethingElse(result);
        await doAnotherThing(newResult);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
    ``` 

### 12.

```
 //file1.js
   let ar = [1,2,3];
   console.log("Hello");
   module.exports.ar = ar; 
```

``` 
   //file2.js
   const {ar} = require('file1.js');
   let print = ar; 
   console.log(print);
```
```
 Output: Hello 
         [1,2,3]
```
Why "Hello" is also printed ? when we have exported array('ar') only!

* When `file2.js` requires `file1.js`, it executes the entire content of `file1.js`.
* This means `console.log("Hello"); in file1.js` is executed, thus printing "Hello".
* Then, module.exports.ar is assigned and file2.js can import it.
