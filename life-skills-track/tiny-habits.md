# Tiny Habits

### 1. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

In this video, I have learned how to make it easy to trigger the tiny habits we wish to do.
```
After I [existing habit],
I will [new tiny behavior] 
```
This is the most interesting idea for me. 

### 2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
* I will find the habits I want to incorporate into my life.
* I will break them into a tiny version of it.
  ``` 
  For eg, I want to make reading books a habit. Its smaller version will be to open the book and read 1 paragraph a day.
  ```

* It will be an easy task and requires less motivation to do.
* I use BJ Fogg's idea of an Action Prompt,
  ```
  After I finish my dinner, I will read one paragraph daily.
  ```
* And I celebrate every small win. 
* In this way, I can incorporate any new habit into my life.
* The formula B=MAP, where B stands for Behavior, M stands for Motivation, A is the ability to do, and P stands for Prompt.


### 3. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? 

* Because I realized this thing.
* When I am doing something, If I feel good and enjoyed to do that, I will continue to do that.
* So to do the small tiny behavior, If I am celebrating after every small win, it will create a success momentum. 
* It will attach some positive feelings to that habit and be helpful for us to do that habit continuously.
* It will be helpful for us to grow in our habits.

### 4. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

* The interesting story I found in this book was the story about British cycling.
* How the concept of 'aggregation of marginal gains' helped them to win lots of gold medals in Olympic history in the long run is the interesting story for me.
* I learnt the power of 1% improvement.

### 5. What is the book's perspective about Identity?


* Outcomes, processes, and identity. 
* Most of the time, we focus on the outcomes and go through the processes, which eventually become our identity. 
* We tend to work in this direction. 
* However, to change our habits, we need to work in the opposite direction. 
* By changing our identity, we can change the processes we follow and eventually achieve the outcomes we want.
* For eg: If we want to become fit (outcome), start by identifying ourself as a health-conscious person (identity). This new identity will lead us to naturally adopt healthier habits like eating nutritious foods and exercising regularly (process), ultimately achieving our fitness goals.

### 6. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
* To make a habit easier to do, simplify the process.
* Make the trigger for the new habit very obvious. For example, if you want to drink more water, keep a water bottle in plain sight.
* Reduce the friction associated with the habit. For instance, lay out your workout clothes the night before to make exercising in the morning easier.
* Use the two-minute rule: start with a version of the habit that takes two minutes or less to complete.
* Create an environment that supports the habit by removing obstacles and adding helpful cues.

### 7. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

* To make a habit harder to do, increase friction and complexity.
* Make the triggers for the habit less obvious. For example, if you want to reduce TV watching, unplug the TV and store the remote in a different room.
* Add steps or obstacles that make the habit more inconvenient. For instance, if you want to stop eating junk food, store it in hard-to-reach places or don't buy it at all.

### 8. Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
Habit: Coding
* **Cue Obvious**: Set a specific time each day for coding and use reminders or alarms.
* **Make it Attractive**: Join a coding community or find a coding buddy for motivation.
* **Make it Easy:** Break tasks into smaller chunks and prepare my coding environment in advance.
* **Make the Response Satisfying:** Track progress, celebrate small wins, and share achievements with others.

### 9. Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
Habit: Eating Junk Food

* **Make the Cue Invisible:** Remove junk food from visible places in my room and avoid places that sell it.
* **Make the Process Unattractive:** Educate myself about the negative health effects of junk food.
* **Make it Hard:** Don't keep junk food at room; make it inconvenient to access.
* **Make the Response Unsatisfying:** Reflect on how junk food makes me feel (e.g., sluggish, guilty).
