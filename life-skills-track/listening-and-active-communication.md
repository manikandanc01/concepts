# Listening and Active Communication


#### Question 1
What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening? 
1. Do not be distracted by your own thoughts. Focus on the speaker and the topic instead.
2. Try not to interrupt the other person. Let them complete their thoughts and then respond.
3. Use door openers (e.g., "Tell me more," "Go ahead, I am listening"). This shows that you are interested in listening.
4. Show that you are listening through your body language.
5. If appropriate, take notes during important conversations.
6. Paraphrase what others have said to ensure you are on the same page.

#### Question 2
According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening? 

1. **Empathy:** Try to understand the speakerâ€™s feelings and thoughts from their perspective.
2. **Acceptance:** Respect the speaker without judging them or their views.
3. **Congruence:** Be honest and genuine with your own feelings while listening.
4. **Concreteness:** Focus on specific details instead of vague statements.

#### Question 3
What are the obstacles in your listening process?

1. **Distracted by Own Thoughts:** Focusing on my own thoughts instead of the speaker.
2. **Interrupting:** Cutting off the speaker before they finish.
3. **Planning a Response:** Thinking about what to say next instead of listening.

#### Question 4
What can you do to improve your listening?

* Focus on the speaker and the current conversation. Avoid letting my mind wander to other thoughts or tasks.
* Let the speaker finish their thoughts before I respond.
* Repeat back what I heard in my own words to ensure understanding.

#### Question 5
When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day to day life?

* When a colleague is highly emotional or upset, it might be better to listen quietly rather than assert my own opinions.
* When I am in a meeting, classroom, or any learning environment.
* When a friend or family member is venting or sharing personal problems,

#### Question 6
When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day to day life?

* If a family member or friend is being threatened or mistreated, I might adopt an aggressive communication style to confront the aggressor.
* If someone is trying to scam me, and I need to be forceful to protect myself from scam.

#### Question 7
When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day to day life?

- When a family member repeatedly disregards my opinions or decisions, I might resort to silent treatment or taunts to express my displeasure without engaging in a direct argument.
- If a friend frequently cancels plans at the last minute, I might respond with sarcasm like, "Oh, no worries, it's not like I had anything better to do," instead of directly addressing the issue.


#### Question 8
How can you make your communication assertive? 

 - First I understand my feelings, what I like and what I don't like.
- If somebody asks for the favour which I don't like to do, I will clearly communicate that with them about my feelings next time.
- First I start practicing assertive communication with my friends and for low-stake situations
