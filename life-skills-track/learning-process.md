# Learning Processs

### 1. What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.

 To understand something well, explain it to others.

 ### 2. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

  * There are two ways of learning: focused mode and diffused mode.
  * An interesting story from a video suggests that when facing complex problems, instead of using focused mode, use diffused mode. 
  * Salvador Dal√≠, the 20th-century surrealist painter, used this technique when confronted with artistic challenges.
  * He would relax in his armchair with keys in his hands.
  * As he relaxed, his arms would loosen, causing the keys to fall to the floor when he fell asleep.
  * Upon waking up, he would integrate ideas from his diffused mode into his focused mode.
  * This is the intersting idea for me.

### 3. What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

* `Active mode` is focused and concentrated thinking, directly tackling tasks or problems. 
* `Diffused mode` is relaxed, allowing your mind to wander and make connections in the background, often leading to creativity and insights.
